## Boba Bud Website

### About

A fun [website](https://umabahl-step-2020.uc.r.appspot.com/) for boba lovers to find nearby tea places! From the homepage, the user searches for a drink:

Once the users chooses a store, they can view it's rating, whether it is open right now, and the location on a dynamic map:
